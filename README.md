# My Watch Tower

> **Advanced satellite tracking and pass prediction system with intelligent filtering and horizon masking**

A satellite tracking application that provides pass predictions for multiple ground stations with real-world visibility calculations based on actual horizon obstacles.

---

### Why This Project?

Traditional satellite tracking tools often fall short in these key areas:

- **Advanced Filtering**: Quickly filter thousands of satellites by custom lists or specific transmitter frequency bands
- **Time-Based Pass Filtering**: Find passes during specific times of day or days of week that fit your schedule
- **Real-World Visibility**: Account for actual horizon obstacles (buildings, trees, mountains) at your observation station, not just theoretical calculations
- **High-Value Pass Extraction**: Automatically identify and extract "high-value" passes based on your criteria and sync them to your calendar
- **Accurate Pass Properties**: Get visibility duration and maximum elevation based on *actual* pass visibility, considering your local horizon mask

---

## Key Features

### Advanced Satellite Filtering

- **Multi-criteria Search**: Filter by satellite name, NORAD ID, custom tags, or frequency bands
- **Frequency Band Filtering**: Support for multiple frequency ranges with uplink/downlink direction
- **Tag Management**: Organize satellites with custom tags (Amateur, METEOR, Orbcomm, YourTag, etc.)
- **Tracked Satellites**: Mark and filter your favorite satellites for quick access

### Ground Station Management

- **Multiple Stations**: Manage unlimited observation locations
- **Horizon Mask Editor**: Interactive polar plot editor to mark obstacles
- **Geographic Visualization**: Interactive maps with geodesic lines and satellite footprints. Real-time visualization of satellite positions and paths

### Pass Prediction Engine

- **Orbit-Based Predictions**: Calculate passes for specific satellites over multiple days
- **Visibility Segmentation**: Split passes into visible segments based on horizon masks
- **Pass Comparison**: Compare the same orbital pass across different ground stations
- **Time Filtering**: Filter passes by time of day and day of week with ability to combine multiple filters

### Real-Time Tracking

- **Live Satellite Position**: Real-time position updates with Doppler shift calculations
- **Pass Progress**: Visual progress indicators for ongoing passes
- **Sky Charts**: Polar plot visualization showing current satellite position and predicted path

### Data Management

- **Automatic TLE Updates**: Configurable TLE sources with automatic refresh
- **SatNOGS DB Integration**: Import transmitter data and satellite information

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: NestJS 11.x (TypeScript, Node.js), PostgreSQL 18 with Prisma ORM, satellite.js, tle.js, Swagger
- **Frontend**: React 19.x with TypeScript, Vite 7.x, Zustand, React Query, Orval, Lucide icons, Leaflet, SCSS

---

## Quick Start

**Note:** This guide assumes a development environment setup. Proper docker images for non-developer audience coming soon.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivan.petrushev/my-watch-tower.git
   cd my-watch-tower
   ```

2. **Start infrastructure services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This starts PostgreSQL, pgAdmin (optional), and Redis (for BullMq).

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
  
   Copy `backend/.env.sample` to `backend/.env`, probably no need to adjust anything.

5. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   npx prisma generate
   ```

6. **Start development servers**

  Start separately:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the application**

   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - API Docs: http://localhost:3000/api
   - pgAdmin: http://localhost:8080 (admin@example.com / admin123)

---

## Development Workflow

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend

# Start dev server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run database migrations after schema change
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Regenerate API client after backend changes
npm run orval

```

### Database Management

**pgAdmin** is available at http://localhost:8080

Default credentials:

- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: admin123

Server connection is pre-configured in `docker-confs/pgadmin-servers.json`.

## Roadmap & TODOs

### High Priority

- [x] **Timeline view**: Visualize upcoming passes in a timeline format
- [x] **Current sky**: Real-time sky chart with all visible satellites
- [ ] **Production Docker Images**: Create optimized Docker images for backend and frontend
- [ ] **Complete Docker Compose**: Production-ready compose file with all services
- [ ] **Calendar Integration**: Sync high-value passes to Google Calendar/iCal

### Features

- [ ] **Satellite info page**: Detailed satellite information,  transmitter list and citations
- [ ] **Pass Logging**: Ability to log observations and attach media
- [ ] **Weather Integration**: Filter passes by weather conditions
- [ ] **Satellite custom tags**: Ability to assign cutom tags to satellite for filtering
- [ ] **Filter saving**: Save and load custom filter presets
- [ ] **Tests**: Both backend and frontend need tests
- [ ] **Pass Statistics**: Historical pass analytics
- [ ] **Multi-language Support**: i18n implementation
- [ ] **News aggregation**: Aggregating news for tracked satellites from several sources

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Automated database backups
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Load testing and optimization

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, access the interactive API documentation:

**Swagger UI**: http://localhost:3000/api

---

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:admin123@localhost:5432/my_watch_tower"
```

No need to change this, if you are running the provided docker-compose.yml.
